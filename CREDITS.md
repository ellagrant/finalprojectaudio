1. "Sound & Color," Alabama Shakes, 2015, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faG8RiaANek. We are using this song under Fair Use because 1) we are using it for non-profit purposes, 2) we are only using the first minute or so and have edited it by changing the pitch at certain parts, reversing parts of it, and making use of cuts, and 3) we do not foresee our use having significant (if any) effect on the original work's value.
